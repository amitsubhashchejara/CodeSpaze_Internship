## Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Notebook**: [internship-eda-task-1.ipynb](https://github.com/amitsubhashchejara/CodeSpaze_Internship/blob/main/internship-eda-task%20(1).ipynb)
  
### Description
This task involved performing data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis on a real-world dataset. Utilizing Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, I aimed to prepare the data for further analysis and model building.

### Key Steps
1. **Dataset Selection**: Chose a dataset from Kaggle.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and normalized data to ensure quality.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Generated visualizations to uncover patterns and correlations within the data.
4. **Conclusion**: Summarized findings based on the EDA.

### Results
The notebook includes visualizations, insights derived from the data, and conclusions drawn from the analysis.

## Build and Train a Simple Machine Learning Model

- **Notebook**: [internship-model-task-1.ipynb](https://github.com/amitsubhashchejara/CodeSpaze_Internship/blob/main/internship-model-task%20(1).ipynb)

### Description
In this task, I implemented a basic machine learning model to understand model training and evaluation processes.

### Key Steps
1. **Algorithm Selection**: Selected an appropriate supervised learning algorithm based on the dataset.
2. **Data Splitting**: Divided the dataset into training and test sets.
3. **Model Training**: Trained the model using the training set.
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Cross-validation**: Applied cross-validation techniques to enhance model reliability.

### Results
The notebook provides detailed explanations of model performance metrics along with visualizations of results.
